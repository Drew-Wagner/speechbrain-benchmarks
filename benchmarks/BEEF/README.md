# Brain and EEG Foundational Model Benchmark (BEEF)
The goal of this project is 

1) To curate brain-recoding datasets suitable for training large-scale models

2) To train foundation models for brain recording, starting with EEG

3)To train foundation models for multiple modalities of brain recording. 

The goal of these foundation models is to achieve state of art results with minimal fine-tuning  cost on diverse brain recording-related tasks.



## üõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è Installation

To set up the benchmark, follow these steps:


1. Clone the benchmark repository and install SpeechBrain:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/benchmarks.git
   cd benchmarks
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   cd speechbrain
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Navigate to `<path-to-repository>/benchmarks/BEEF` in your file system, open a terminal, and run the following commands:

   ```shell
   pip install -r ../../requirements.txt    # Install base dependencies
   pip install -r extra-requirements.txt    # Install additional dependencies
   ```

   These commands will install the necessary dependencies for the benchmark, including both the base requirements and the additional requirements (i.e., kenlm for the n-gram language model).

## üìàÔ∏è Results

The following table shows the results obtained with 
All the experiments presented in this work, including those with large SSL encoders such as Data2Vec Large, should be able to run on a 32Gb V100 GPU with the batch sizes provided in the yaml files. These batch sizes may be increased for faster training with smaller "Base" SSL encoders.
